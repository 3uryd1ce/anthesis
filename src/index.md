# Projects I'm working on

I publish the source code of my projects
here. [stagit](https://github.com/oxalorg/stagit) generates HTML pages
from git repositories.

Note that `.git` must be appended to the given repository's URL in order
to clone it. For example, to clone my dotfiles:

    $ git clone "https://amissing.link/src/dotfiles/.git"

- [Website (Markdown)](/src/website_md)
- [Dotfiles](/src/dotfiles)
- [COBS](/src/cobs)
