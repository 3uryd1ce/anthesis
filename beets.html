						with beets</h2>

					<p>
					Have you ever stopped to consider how important it is to have
					proper metadata for your music files? If you maintain your own
					music library, you probably already know how helpful it is from
					experience.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 id="importance-of-metadata">Why is metadata
						important?</h3>

						<p>
						Tagged music files come with a lot of benefits. To name
						just a few:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
							<p>
							You know what to expect from your music without
							relying on mile-long filenames or navigating through
							a forest of directories.
							</p>
							</li>

							<li>
							<p>
							You can easily find what you&#8217;re looking for by
							querying the metadata.
							</p>
							</li>

							<li>
							<p>
							ReplayGain normalizes loudness so that your hand can
							rest somewhere other than the volume knob.
							</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 id="beets-makes-it-easy">Take the easy way out</h3>
					<p>
					The unfortunate part is that tagging everything yourself can
					be a laborious task, and some people give up before finding
					a better solution. Even something like fetching and
					embedding album art can quickly become a pain without
					intelligent software to do the hard work for you.
					</p>

					<p>
					The good news is that some other developers decided a while
					ago that &#8220;enough is enough.&#8221; Now you can
					<a href="https://beets.io/">use beets to manage your music</a>.
					It makes handling your collection so much simpler by
					fetching metadata from
					<a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>.
					</p>

					<h3 id="installation">Installing beets</h3>

					<p>
					I demonstrate how to install beets on
					<a href="https://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>
					here. That said, beets is available for installation on many
					other operating systems as well.
					</p>

					<pre># <kbd>pkg_add beets</kbd></pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 id="configuration">Configuring beets (if needed)</h3>

					<p>
					By default, beets places imported music in
					<code>~/Music</code>. If this is acceptable, feel free to
					skip this section.
					</p>

					<p>
					If you do need to change it, add the desired path to the
					<code>config.yaml</code> file like so:
					</p>

					<pre><code>directory: /path/to/music/library</code></pre>

					<p>
					Chances are that you can go straight to importing music
					without any further modifications. If you do encounter
					issues, consult the
					<a href="https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/config.html">
					documentation on configuration</a>.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 id="importing-music">Importing music</h3>

					<p>
					To be useful, beets needs a library to work with. That means
					you need to import some music. Fortunately, this is very
					easy to do.
					</p>

					<pre>$ <kbd>beet import /path/to/album</kbd></pre>

					<p>
					If the similarity score is high enough, beets tags the music
					automatically and moves on. Otherwise, it&#8217;ll prompt
					you for additional details.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 id="querying-music">Querying music</h3>

					<p>
					To sift through some of your music, use <kbd>beet ls</kbd>.
					</p>

					<p>
					When you do so, it&#8217;s often best to narrow down your
					query with the available metadata fields. This includes
					things like
					<code>genre</code>,
					<code>artist</code>,
					<code>album</code>,
					<code>year</code>,
					<code>country</code>,
					and so on.
					</p>

					<p>
					Here&#8217;s an example where I query by genre (note that
					you need to use the
					<a href="#plugins-genre">lastgenre plugin</a>
					for this to work).
					</p>

					<pre>$ <kbd>beet ls genre:'Progressive Rock'</kbd></pre>

					<p>
					You don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to quote it as I&#8217;ve done
					here. I do it out of habit, as whitespace is typically
					significant in the shell.
					</p>

					<p>
					As a side note, you can list what metadata fields are
					available with <kbd>beet fields</kbd>.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 id="plugins">Plugins</h3>

					<p>
					There are many high quality plugins for beets that extend
					its functionality and make it even more appealing.
					I&#8217;ll only demonstrate fetching album art and genre
					information here, but please do check out the
					<a href="https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins/">
						documentation on plugins</a>
					to see how many other things are possible.
					</p>

					<section>
						<h4 id="plugins-album-art">Album art</h4>

						<p>
						If you use
						<a href="https://rybczak.net/ncmpcpp/"
							title="NCurses Music Player C++">
							NCMPCPP as a music player</a>
						and
						<a href="https://www.musicpd.org/"
							title="Music Player Daemon">
							MPD as a music server</a>
						like I do, then this may not matter as much to you.

						However, with more
						<a href="https://kodi.tv/">
							full-featured media applications like Kodi</a>,
						missing artwork can stick out like a sore thumb.
						</p>

						<p>
						Thankfully, there&#8217;s an easy fix for this. Add this
						to your <code>config.yaml</code>:
						</p>

						<pre><code>plugins: fetchart</code></pre>

						<p>
						Then, update the library.
						</p>

						<pre>$ <kbd>beet fetchart</kbd></pre>

						<p>
						For more details, see the
						<a href="https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins/fetchart.html">
							documentation for fetchart</a>.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4 id="plugins-genre">Genre</h4>

						<p>
						Out of the box, beets actually doesn&#8217;t deal with
						genres at all because MusicBrainz doesn&#8217;t have
						that information. Many people consider sorting by genre
						an important feature to have.
						</p>

						<p>
						To add genre information to your collection by pulling
						from <a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>,
						put this inside your <code>config.yaml</code>:
						</p>

						<pre><code>plugins: lastgenre</code></pre>

						<p>
						Then, update the library.
						</p>

						<pre>$ <kbd>beet lastgenre</kbd></pre>

						<p>
						For more details, see the
						<a href="https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins/lastgenre.html">
							documentation for lastgenre</a>.

					<h3 id="cue-splitting">Cue splitting</h3>

					<p>
					Beets needs a separate file for each track to tag music, yet
					sometimes there&#8217;s only one FLAC file for the entire
					album (it can also be something other than FLAC, but for
					this example I&#8217;ll assume it&#8217;s a FLAC file).
					</p>

					<p>
					The nice thing is that as long as you have a cue
					sheet&#8212;a text file that describes the album&#8217;s
					track layout with timestamps&#8212;that
					single FLAC file can be split into separate files by track
					(&#8220;cue splitting&#8221;).
					</p>

					<p>
					Here&#8217;s how I split a file like this into multiple
					files given a cue sheet.
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
						<p>
						Install <code>shntool</code> for cue splitting, and
						<code>cuetools</code> to tag the resulting files.
						</p>

						<pre># <kbd>pkg_add shntool cuetools</kbd></pre>
						</li>

						<li>
						<p>
						Navigate to the album in question.
						</p>

						<pre>$ <kbd>cd /path/to/album</kbd></pre>
						</li>

						<li>
						<p>
						Split the FLAC file.
						</p>

						<p>
						<code>-f</code> points to the cue sheet.
						<code>-o</code> is the encoder, which defaults to WAV.
						</p>

						<p>
						By default, the output format looks like
						<code>split-track01.flac</code>. Beets will rename the
						files according to the metadata anyway, so it
						doesn&#8217;t matter too much.
						</p>

						<pre>$ <kbd>shnsplit -f example.cue -o flac example.flac</kbd></pre>
						</li>

						<li>
						<p>
						Rename the FLAC file so that it ends in
						<code>.bak</code>.
						</p>

						<p>
						This is needed for the next step so that the original
						FLAC file won&#8217;t be targeted by
						<code>cuetag</code>.
						</p>
						<pre>$ <kbd>mv example.flac{,.bak}</kbd></pre>
						</li>

						<li>
						<p>
						Tag the split files with the original metadata.
						</p>

						<p>
						<code>./*.flac</code> targets all FLAC files in the
						current directory. See
						<a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2035">
							SC2035</a>
						for an explanation of why I use <code>./*.flac</code>
						instead of <code>*.flac</code>.
						</p>

						<pre>$ <kbd>cuetag example.cue ./*.flac</kbd></pre>
						</li>

						<li>
						<p>
						If satisfied, delete the original FLAC file.
						</p>

						<pre>$ <kbd>rm example.flac.bak</kbd></pre>
						</li>

						<li>
						<p>
						Now that everything is split into tracks, you can import the
						music.

						<pre>$ <kbd>beet import .</kbd></pre>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h3 id="scripting-cue-splitting">Scripting cue splitting</h3>

					<p>
					Given that this is a bit tedious,
					<a href="/src/dotfiles/file/.local/bin/splitflac.html">
					I wrote a small shell script</a>
					to take care of splitting FLAC files for me.

					<code>splitflac</code> is used like so:
					</p>

					<pre>$ <kbd>splitflac example.cue example.flac</kbd></pre>

					<p>
					By default, <code>splitflac</code> doesn&#8217;t delete the
					original FLAC file. To do so on a successful split, pass the
					<code>-d</code> flag.
					</p>

					<pre>$ <kbd>splitflac -d example.cue example.flac</kbd></pre>
