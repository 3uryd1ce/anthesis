				<p>
				Maybe you&#8217;ve been here many times in the past and you
				already know this website like the back of your hand. Or perhaps
				you&#8217;re still developing that sense of comfort and
				familiarity each time you return here. This may even be the very
				first time you&#8217;ve visited, and you&#8217;re wondering what
				this is all about&#8230;
				</p>

				<section>
					<h3 id="new-visitors">For those that feel less familiar</h3>

					<p>
					If you&#8217;re new here or if it&#8217;s been a while, take
					a moment to notice where you are and how to find your way
					back. I don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;ll bookmark this
					page or
					<a href="https://www.anthes.is/rss.xml">subscribe to my RSS feed</a>
					to do so, but both of these things make coming back here as
					often as you like a simple process.

				<h2 id="subjects">What can you read about here?</h2>

				<p>
				Though I tend to write about
				<abbr title=
					"BSD is short for &#8220;Berkeley System Distribution.&#8221;">
					OpenBSD</abbr>
				and Information Technology (IT), I find plenty of other subjects
				fascinating as well. Among them are music and psychology. But
				because I&#8217;m captivated by so many things, you&#8217;ll be
				reading for a while if I list them all out.
				</p>

				<p>
				All the same, feel free to continue scrolling down. Sometimes
				discovering what you have in common with someone else can pique
				your interest and curiosity.
