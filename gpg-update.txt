# My GPG keys are now updated

My original RSA2048 public key is set to expire August 3rd, 2021, so
intervention is needed in some form. Looking to the future, I think it's
a good idea to switch to elliptic curve cryptography, specifically
ed25519.

Given this, my current public key, located at '/pubkeys/eurydice.key',
uses ed25519 and is set to expire July 14th, 2022. My old public key,
located at '/pubkeys/old-rsa2048.key', will remain accessible for a time
because it was used to sign both this document and the ed25519 key.
