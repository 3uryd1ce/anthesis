# My GPG keys are now updated

My original RSA2048 public key is set to expire August 3rd, 2021, so
intervention is needed in some form. Looking to the future, I think it's
a good idea to switch to elliptic curve cryptography, specifically
ed25519.

Given this, my current public key, located at '/eurydice.key', uses
ed25519 and is set to expire July 14th, 2022. My old public key, located
at '/old-rsa2048.key', will remain accessible for a time because this
document is signed with it.
