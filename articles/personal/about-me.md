# About me

## Interests

- A good audio setup is something I deeply appreciate. Currently, I
  enjoy listening to music with the Hifiman Sundara, Sennheiser HD600,
  and E-MU Teak. To drive my headphones and produce better sound, the
  Monoprice Monolith THX 887 sits on my desk with the Topping E30 on
  top of it.

- Improvising/composing music (piano is my instrument of choice) can be
  really cathartic. I'm fortunate enough to have perfect pitch.

- Gaming helps me relax and reminds me that there is value in simply
  being. Metroidvanias, platformers, RPGs, roguelikes, and strategy
  games are among my favorite genres.

- [Meditation heals the
  mind](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients/),
  so I practice mindfulness.

- Taking time to improve, learn, and cultivate awareness is my
  lifeblood. That said, I find it important to remind myself from time
  to time that imperfection and setbacks are an immutable part of
  the human condition. Striving to be perfect is a form of self-sabotage.

- Psychology has fascinated me for as long as I can remember. Ever since
  I was a kid, I've observed people because there's a lesson embedded in
  every interaction. Additionally, psychology in tandem with
  mindfulness helps me remember that even those most distant from my
  convictions are human and worthy of kindness.

- Writing is another pastime I hold dear. In particular, I like to teach
  through writing. I yearn to share my knowledge with others, and
  teaching is one of the best ways to learn.

- Applying philosophy's teachings can be useful, though discussing
  it at length here would be putting Descartes before the horse.

- Of course, tech captivates me as well. Computers are the most patient
  teachers a student could ask for.

## Qualities I value

To be clear: this isn't a laundry list of expectations. In my
experience, superfluous expectations create distance,[^1] whereas intimacy
manifests when you embrace a person as they are. In addition,
exclusively looking for those that match a set of criteria can lead to
discarding what's right in front of you, like a packet filter with a
misconfigured ruleset.

[^1]: That isn't to say that one should abandon the concept of
  boundaries altogether. Boundaries are healthy and represent you
  communicating what you need to another person. There's a difference
  between advocating for yourself and domineering someone.

That said, humans recognize and seek patterns. People with some of these
characteristics seem to endear themselves to me quickly.

- A sense of humor (even dad jokes are OK).
- Ambition/a will to improve.
- Compassion.
- Honesty. Please be direct with me and clearly communicate what you need.
- Humility.
- Mindfulness.
- Openness.
- Passion.
- Resilience.
- Tranquility. Passion and tranquility seem like
  they would contradict one another, yet they can coexist. For instance,
  a sense of inner stillness doesn't mean one's hunger for knowledge
  must disappear.
