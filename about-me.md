# About me

To preface this, I don't think it's possible to perfectly condense
anyone into a set of words. That said, I think there's value in learning
how to describe myself concisely. It allows me to reflect on what's of
interest to others and how I'm growing as an individual.

## Things I engage in

- I deeply appreciate a good audio setup, given that I listen to music
  often. My current collection includes the Hifiman Sundara, Sennheiser
  HD600, and E-MU Teak. To drive my headphones and produce better sound,
  the Monoprice Monolith THX 887 sits on my desk with the Topping E30 on
  top of it.
- I enjoy playing piano. I'm fortunate enough to have perfect pitch,
  which helps with improvisation.
- I play games from time to time. It helps me to avoid burnout and
  relax. Metroidvanias, platformers, RPGs, roguelikes, and strategy
  games are among my favorite genres.
- I meditate at least once a day because it heals the soul and
  mind. [Tara Brach offers some excellent guided
  meditations](https://www.tarabrach.com/guided-meditations/).
- I consider self-improvement, learning, and metacognition to be
  crucial. Mindfulness is immensely helpful for me in that regard, as
  a state of flow is conducive to all of those things.
- I appreciate psychology as a subject. Even those most distant from my
  convictions are an amalgamation of the same emotional and physical
  constituents that comprise me (albeit in a different configuration, and
  with a different end result). For this reason, I engage in the
  [principle of
  charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity).
- I like to write. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn, not to
  mention that writing can be fulfilling and thought-provoking.
- I consider philosophy's teachings and apply them, though discussing
  philosophy on this page would be putting Descartes before the horse.
- I advocate for FLOSS (free/libre and open source software) and
  generally involve myself with tech often because it presents
  interesting problems for me to solve.
