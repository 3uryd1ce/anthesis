# About me

## Interests

- A good audio setup is something I deeply appreciate. Currently, I
  enjoy listening to music with the Hifiman Sundara and Sennheiser
  HD600. To drive my headphones and produce better sound, the Monoprice
  Monolith THX 887 sits on my desk with the Topping E30 on top of it.

- Improvising/composing music (piano is my instrument of choice) can be
  really cathartic. I'm fortunate enough to have perfect pitch.

- Gaming helps me relax and reminds me that there is value in simply
  being. Metroidvanias, platformers, (J)RPGs, roguelikes, and strategy
  games are among my favorite genres.

- Taking time to improve, learn, and cultivate awareness is my
  lifeblood. That said, I find it important to remind myself from time
  to time that imperfection and setbacks are an immutable part of
  the human condition. Striving to be perfect is a form of self-sabotage.

- Psychology has fascinated me for some time. I often end up people
  watching in situations that allow it because I find it interesting.
  There are many lessons to be learned in observing others.

- Writing is another pastime I hold dear. In particular, I like to teach
  through writing. I yearn to share my knowledge with others, and
  teaching is one of the best ways to learn.

- Applying philosophy's teachings can be useful, though discussing
  it at length here would be putting Descartes before the horse.

- Of course, tech captivates me as well. Computers are the most patient
  teachers a student could ask for.
