# About me

## Interests

- A good audio setup is something I deeply appreciate. Currently, I
  enjoy listening to music with the Hifiman Sundara, Sennheiser HD600,
  and E-MU Teak. To drive my headphones and produce better sound, the
  Monoprice Monolith THX 887 sits on my desk with the Topping E30 on
  top of it.

- Improvising/composing music (piano is my instrument of choice) can be
  really cathartic. I'm fortunate enough to have perfect pitch.

- Gaming helps me relax and reminds me that there is value in simply
  being. Metroidvanias, platformers, RPGs, roguelikes, and strategy
  games are among my favorite genres.

- Taking time to improve, learn, and cultivate awareness is my
  lifeblood. That said, I find it important to remind myself from time
  to time that imperfection and setbacks are an immutable part of
  the human condition. Striving to be perfect is a form of self-sabotage.

- Psychology has fascinated me for as long as I can remember. Ever since
  I was a kid, I've observed people because there's a lesson embedded in
  every interaction. Additionally, psychology in tandem with
  mindfulness helps me remember that even those most distant from my
  convictions are human and worthy of kindness.

- Writing is another pastime I hold dear. In particular, I like to teach
  through writing. I yearn to share my knowledge with others, and
  teaching is one of the best ways to learn.

- Applying philosophy's teachings can be useful, though discussing
  it at length here would be putting Descartes before the horse.

- Of course, tech captivates me as well. Computers are the most patient
  teachers a student could ask for.
