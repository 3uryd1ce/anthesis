# About me

To preface this, it's impossible to perfectly condense anyone into a set
of words. That said, there's value in learning how to describe myself
concisely. It allows me to reflect on what's of interest to others and
how I'm growing as an individual.

## Interests

- I deeply appreciate a good audio setup, given that I listen to music
  often. My current collection includes the Hifiman Sundara, Sennheiser
  HD600, and E-MU Teak. To drive my headphones and produce better sound,
  the Monoprice Monolith THX 887 sits on my desk with the Topping E30 on
  top of it.

- I enjoy playing piano. I'm fortunate enough to have perfect pitch,
  which helps with improvisation.

- I play games from time to time (see [Stuff
  I self-host](/why-self-host.html#Stuff%20I%20self-host)). Video games
  help me to avoid burnout and relax. Metroidvanias, platformers, RPGs,
  roguelikes, and strategy games are among my favorite genres.

- I meditate because [meditation heals the
  mind](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients/).
  [Tara Brach offers some excellent guided
  meditations](https://www.tarabrach.com/guided-meditations/).

- I find self-improvement, learning, and metacognition are
  crucial (those aspirations are part of what give my life
  meaning). Mindfulness helps me explore those things and better myself,
  as it's difficult for one to improve without awareness and presence.

- I appreciate psychology. Even those most distant from my
  convictions are comprised of the same physical and emotional
  constituents (albeit in a different configuration with a different end
  result). For this reason, I engage in the [principle of
  charity](https://www.csus.edu/indiv/m/mayesgr/phl4/tutorial/phl4charity.htm).

- I like to write. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn, not to
  mention that writing can be fulfilling and thought-provoking. Writing
  helps me understand how to effectively convey my ideas.

- I contemplate philosophy's teachings and apply them, though discussing
  philosophy on this page would be putting Descartes before the horse.

- I involve myself with tech because it presents interesting problems
  for me to solve. Computers are the most patient teachers a student
  could ask for.

## Qualities I value

To be clear: this isn't a laundry list of expectations I carry with me
when I meet people. I try to accept people as they are. In my
experience, a person's value crystallizes in the absence of arbitrary
comparisons. In addition, looking for someone that matches a set of
criteria can sometimes lead to discarding what's right in front of you,
like a packet filter with a misconfigured ruleset.

That said, humans seek patterns. The people I hold dear tend to possess
some of these characteristics.

- A sense of humor (even dad jokes are OK).
- Ambition/a will to improve.
- Compassion.
- Honesty. Be direct with me and clearly communicate what you need.
- Humility.
- Mindfulness.
- Openness.
- Passion.
- Resilience.
- Tranquility. Passion and tranquility seem like
  they would contradict one another, yet they can coexist. For instance,
  a sense of inner stillness doesn't mean one's hunger for knowledge
  must disappear.
