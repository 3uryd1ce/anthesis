# About me

To preface this, I don't think it's possible to perfectly condense
anyone into a set of words. That said, I think there's value in learning
how to describe myself concisely. It allows me to reflect on what's of
interest to others and how I'm growing as an individual.

## Things I engage in

- I deeply appreciate a good audio setup, given that I listen to music
  often. My current collection includes the Hifiman Sundara, Sennheiser
  HD600, and E-MU Teak. To drive my headphones and produce better sound,
  the Monoprice Monolith THX 887 sits on my desk with the Topping E30 on
  top of it.

- I enjoy playing piano. I'm fortunate enough to have perfect pitch,
  which helps with improvisation.

- I play games from time to time (see [Stuff
  I self-host](/why-self-host.html#Stuff%20I%20self-host)). Video games
  help me to avoid burnout and relax. Metroidvanias, platformers, RPGs,
  roguelikes, and strategy games are among my favorite genres.

- I try my best to meditate once a day because [meditation heals the
  mind](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients/). [Tara
  Brach offers some excellent guided
  meditations](https://www.tarabrach.com/guided-meditations/).

- I find self-improvement, learning, and metacognition are
  crucial (those aspirations are part of what give my life
  meaning). Mindfulness helps me explore those things and better myself,
  as it's difficult for one to improve without awareness and presence.

- I appreciate psychology. Even those most distant from my
  convictions are comprised of the same physical and emotional
  constituents (albeit in a different configuration with a different end
  result). For this reason, I engage in the [principle of
  charity](https://www.csus.edu/indiv/m/mayesgr/phl4/tutorial/phl4charity.htm).

- I like to write. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn, not to
  mention that writing can be fulfilling and thought-provoking. Writing
  helps me understand how to effectively convey my ideas.

- I contemplate philosophy's teachings and apply them, though discussing
  philosophy on this page would be putting Descartes before the horse.

- I involve myself with tech because it presents interesting problems
  for me to solve.
