					>Search sites directly with Firefox</h2>

					<p>
					Many people use a search engine to navigate the Internet.
					But what you might not know is that
					Firefox<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">note 1</a></sup>
					lets you easily search many different websites with the
					<a
						href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-search-from-address-bar"
						title="Mozilla's support article on searching with keywords."
					>add keyword feature</a>.

					<h3 id="why-use-keywords">Why use keywords?</h3>

					<p>
					For a number of reasons, keywords can be a very useful tool
					for you.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
						<p>
						<em>Better online privacy</em>. Only query and send data
						to the site you want answers from, right?
						</p>
						</li>

						<li>
						<p>
						<em>It saves time</em>. Once set up, this method allows
						you to do it all in one easy step&#8212;even when
						you&#8217;re on a different web page or in a blank
						tab/window.
						</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 id="wiktionary-example">Using Wiktionary as an example</h3>

					<p>
					Let&#8217;s take
					<a href="https://www.wiktionary.org/"
					>Wiktionary, the multilingual dictionary</a>
					as an example.
					</p>

					<p>
					Navigate to Wiktionary and right click Wiktionary&#8217;s
					search bar. A context menu will pop up with a number of
					entries. Click the &#8220;Add a Keyword for this
					Search&#8230;&#8221; entry.
					</p>

						<img

							alt=
								"Inside a context menu, the &#8220;Add a Keyword
								for this Search&#8230;&#8221; entry is
								highlighted."
							decoding="async"
							height="370"
							width="358"
						/>
					</picture>

					<p>
					Firefox will now present a dialog box with three options.
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
						The <em>name</em> of the bookmark.
						</li>

						<li>
						The <em>location</em> to save the bookmark in.
						</li>

						<li>
						The <em>keyword</em> to use for the bookmark.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
					Choose a name and location if you like, then type in your
					desired keyword and click &#8220;Save.&#8221; I chose
					<kbd>wkt</kbd>.
					</p>

						<source
							srcset="/images/add-keyword-2.webp"
							type="image/webp"
						/>
					<img
						src="/images/add-keyword-2.png"
						alt=
							"A dialog box that asks for the name of the
							bookmark, the folder to save it in, and the
							keyword."

					<h3 id="testing-your-keyword">Testing your new keyword</h3>

					<p>
					Now it&#8217;s possible to find the definition of a word by
					typing <kbd>wkt</kbd> (or whatever you chose as a keyword)
					into Firefox&#8217;s search bar, followed by the word you
					want to know the meaning of.
					</p>

					<p>
					Here&#8217;s an exercise to test your new keyword:
					what&#8217;s the difference between
					&#8220;somnambulism&#8221; and &#8220;funambulism?&#8221;
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 id="what-else-is-possible">What else is possible?</h3>

					<p>
					Keywords work with ordinary bookmarks, too. The main
					difference with regular bookmarks is that nothing is typed
					except the keyword (so, it&#8217;s really just a quick way
					to get to a specific web page you like).
