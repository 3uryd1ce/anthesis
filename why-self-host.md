# Why self-host/use FLOSS?

People often don't understand why I choose to be my own provider and use
libre software, or why I won't repair a broken Windows/macOS
installation.[^1]

[^1]: I realize that refusing to repair proprietary operating systems
  can come across as 'holier-than-thou.' That said, I don't want to
  contribute to the success Microsoft and Apple enjoy, nor their hold on
  those that want my aid, for reasons mentioned in this document.

Allow me to explain my reasoning/proselytize. Libre software has
these benefits among others:

- Free as in freedom and free as in free beer.
- Libre software is collaborative. Bugs are reported, pull requests are
  made, and the software is better for everyone as a result. Even those
  that aren't developers.
- Transparent. The behavior of a given program can be verified;
  consequently, FLOSS can be more private and secure since others
  review the source code.
- More likely to adhere to the [Unix
  philosophy](https://web.mit.edu/6.055/old/S2009/notes/unix.pdf).
- People in the community volunteer their time to help others in need.
- Unmaintained software can later be revived because the source code is
  available.
- Old hardware is still viable many years later--no more planned obsolescence
  and forced upgrades.

Contrast the above with the experience [proprietary
software](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.en.html) offers:

- DRM means the user doesn't own anything in the undiluted sense of the
  word. It can be taken away from them on a whim, or they can get locked
  out if they refuse to comply with unreasonable terms of service.
- Deliberately incompatible (try moving photos from macOS/iOS to
  a device outside Apple's ecosystem).
- No say in the development process. Users barely have a voice in
  general.
- Surveillance is commonplace and it's harder to tell what exactly
  a program is doing. [Both Apple and Microsoft cooperate with the
  NSA](/images/Prism_slide_5.jpg).
- Planned obsolescence and forced upgrades.
- Censorship.
- Proprietary software is developed with the express purpose of turning
  a profit. Large companies tend to turn a blind eye to flagrant
  violations of ethics and freedom if they further that end.
- Misleads and takes advantage of users.
- Any funds that go toward proprietary software perpetuate these
  problems.

Understand that my intent here isn't to be negative, nor do I want to
attack those that use proprietary software. It's the companies that make
said software that are to blame, not the users, and any honest account
of these injustices is bound to be negative.

Instead, I've outlined the differences so I can drive this point home:
**those who run proprietary software are the product**. I've experienced
it firsthand and I'm certain that people deserve better.

Of course, this raises the following question: if proprietary software
takes advantage of the user, how can the user combat that?

A good way to regain freedom is to exchange software that violates
privacy/user rights for software that respects these values. That is to
say, [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) instead of Microsoft
Office, [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) instead of Zoom, [Tor
Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) instead of a proprietary browser,
and so on.

Bear in mind that this process doesn't have to be all or
nothing. Gradually replace things as comfortable and note the
differences. If those differences are more positive than negative,
embrace it.
