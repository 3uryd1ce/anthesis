# Why self-host/use FLOSS?

People often don't understand why I choose to be my own provider and use
libre software, or why I won't (re)install Windows or macOS for
someone.[^1]

[^1]: I would recover someone's data for them if they had a broken
  installation. That said, I refuse to (re)install proprietary operating
  systems because I don't want to contribute to the aforementioned
  problems. Exploitative software is malware, and that must not be
  passed on (unless it is for security research, study, or something to
  that effect).

Allow me to explain my reasoning/proselytize. Libre software has
these benefits among others:

- Free as in freedom (the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study,
  change and improve the software) and free as in free coffee. However,
  developers appreciate/need donations.
- Libre software is collaborative. Bugs are reported, pull requests are
  made, and the software is better for everyone as a result. Even those
  that aren't developers.
- Transparent. The behavior of a given program can be verified due to
  source code availability; consequently, qualms about privacy and
  security can be resolved more easily, and unmaintained FLOSS can
  always be revived at a later date.

Contrast the above with the experience [proprietary
software](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.en.html) offers:

- DRM means the user doesn't own anything in the undiluted sense of the
  word. It can be taken away from them on a whim, or they can get locked
  out if they refuse to comply with unreasonable terms of service.
- Deliberate incompatibility (try moving photos from macOS/iOS to
  a device outside Apple's ecosystem).
- Surveillance is commonplace and it's harder to tell what exactly
  a program is doing. [Both Apple and Microsoft cooperate with the
  NSA](/images/Prism_slide_5.jpg).
- Planned obsolescence, which nickels and dimes users.
- Proprietary software exists to turn a profit. Large companies have
  enough power that they can (and do) turn a blind eye to flagrant
  violations of ethics and freedom ([Apple is complicit in the Great
  Firewall of
  China](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/technology/china-apple-censorhip.html),
  for instance) if they further that end.

Understand that my intent here isn't to be negative, nor do I want to
attack those that use proprietary software. It's the companies that make
said software that are to blame, not the users, and any honest account
of these injustices is bound to be negative.

Instead, I've outlined the differences so I can drive this point home:
**those who run proprietary software are the product**. I've experienced
it firsthand and I'm certain that people deserve better.

This raises a question: if proprietary software enables
developers to take advantage of those that run their software, how can
the end user combat that?

A good way to regain freedom is to exchange software that violates
privacy/user rights for software that respects these values. That is to
say, [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) instead of Microsoft
Office, [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) instead of Zoom, [Tor
Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) instead of a proprietary browser,
and so on.

Bear in mind that this process doesn't have to be all or
nothing. Gradually replace things as comfortable and note the
differences. If those differences are more positive than negative,
embrace it.
