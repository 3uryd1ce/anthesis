# "Linux can't do X"

I'll take off my OpenBSD hat for a moment to address something that's
bothered me for a while.

People are quick to suggest a system is incapable of something;
sometimes, these people have never booted the system they're
criticizing.

Linux is denounced in many areas, from gaming to photo editing to
user-friendliness, yet in reality it's sufficient for most people's
needs. If [a 77-year-old grandma can learn how to use
Linux](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/gxlkuw/i_recently_taught_my_grandma_77_linux/),
you can learn how to use it, too.

Usually, I find that mindset is the underlying reason for perceived
deficiencies. Remember that [Linux is NOT
Windows](https://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm).

## Alleged incapabilities

For any of these categories, feel free to use the ["List of
Applications" ArchWiki entry](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications)
as a supplementary resource.

1. "Linux can't game."

   I concede that Linux can't play every Windows game. Let me ask you
   this: if Linux supports more games than most people can play in a
   lifetime, does it matter that it doesn't support every single game
   out there?  Linux can play more games than any console I can think
   of.

    don't particularly like Reddit; that said, I consult subreddit wikis
    from time to time because they can have useful content.

1. "Linux can't handle photos."

   Mostly comes from people used to the Adobe suite. It's also not true.

## Linux is powerful

If you're not convinced that Linux is good enough for your needs, here
are some places you can find Linux:

- [Linux runs on the top 500
  supercomputers](https://www.top500.org/statistics/details/osfam/1/).
- Your favorite website is almost
  certainly [powered by a Unix-like operating
  system](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-unix) ([probably
  Linux](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux)).
- Linux is good enough for Google--both Android and ChromeOS are based
  on it.
