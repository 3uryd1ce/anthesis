# "Linux can't do X"

People are quick to suggest a system is incapable of something. Often I
see things online saying that Linux is terrible compared to Windows or
macOS at handling *X*, or that it is unfriendly to users. Yet, I know of
at least one [77-year-old grandma that learned how to use
Linux](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/gxlkuw/i_recently_taught_my_grandma_77_linux/),
and have always been able to find an application to perform the task I
needed on Linux. From my point of view, Linux has never been more
user-friendly and powerful than it is now.

Usually, I find that mindset is the underlying reason for perceived
deficiencies. Remember that [Linux is NOT
Windows](https://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm). Your new favorite
program for a specific task may very well not be the first one you try.
However, that is no reason in itself to discard an operating system
wholesale.

## Linux is powerful

If you're not convinced that Linux is good enough for your needs, here
are some places you can find Linux:

- [Linux runs on the top 500
  supercomputers](https://www.top500.org/statistics/details/osfam/1/).
- Your favorite website is almost
  certainly [powered by a Unix-like operating
  system](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-unix) ([probably
  Linux](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux)).
- Linux is good enough for Google--both Android and ChromeOS are based
  on it.
