# "Linux can't do X"

Often I see things online saying that Linux is terrible compared to
Windows or macOS at handling *X*, or that it is not user-friendly. Yet
from my point of view, Linux has never been more user-friendly and

it is the case that a new favorite program for a specific task is not
the first one a person tries, and it takes effort to learn a new way of

For any of these categories, feel free to use the ["List of
Applications" ArchWiki
entry](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications) as a
supplementary resource.

For this article, I will focus only on GUI applications. Even though
there are many powerful CLI applications I am fond of, this article is
tailored to those less familiar with Linux.

## Linux is powerful

Here are some places Linux can be found:

- [Linux runs on the top 500
  supercomputers](https://www.top500.org/statistics/details/osfam/1/).
- Most websites are [powered by a Unix-like operating
  system](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-unix) ([probably
  Linux](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux)).
- Linux is good enough for Google--both Android and ChromeOS are based
  on it.
