# "Linux can't do X"

I'll take off my OpenBSD hat for a moment to address something that's
bothered me for a while.

People are quick to suggest a system is incapable of something;
sometimes, these people have never even booted a Linux system. Yet they
seem to magically know its limitations. I've heard this regarding
everything from gaming to photo editing, and it's simply not true when
one consults the facts.

## Alleged incapabilities

For any of these categories, feel free to use the [ArchWiki's List of
Applications](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications)
as a supplementary resource.

1. "Linux can't game."

   I'll concede Linux can't play every Windows game, but let me ask you
   this: if Linux supports more games than most people can play in a
   lifetime, does it matter that it doesn't support every single game
   out there?  Linux can play more games than any console I can think
   of.

    don't particularly like Reddit; that said, I consult subreddit wikis
    from time to time because they sometimes house decent content. Note
    the number of people that have subscribed to that subreddit.

1. "Linux can't handle photos."

   Mostly comes from people used to the Adobe suite. It's also not true.

## Linux is powerful

If you're still not convinced that Linux is good enough for your needs,
here are some places you can find Linux:

- [Linux runs on the top 500
  supercomputers](https://www.top500.org/statistics/details/osfam/1/).
- Your favorite website is almost
  certainly [powered by a Unix-like operating
  system](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-unix) ([probably
  Linux](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux)).
- Linux is good enough for Google--both Android and ChromeOS are based
  on it.
