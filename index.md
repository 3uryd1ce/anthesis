# There's no place like /home

Hey, I'm Ashlen. I'm an [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) fanatic,
a sysadmin/webdev, and a musician among other things. Passion, a sense
of humor (even dad jokes have their place), resilience, humility,
kindness, a will to improve, and an open mind are qualities I value in
a person.

I maintain `amissing.link` for three main reasons:

1. A personal website is among the freest forms of expression a person
   can have.

1. Many sites these days are overengineered and/or hostile to those
   that value privacy. Developing and hosting a minimal,
   privacy-respecting website allows me to be the change I want to see
   in the world.

1. Writing about and sharing my discoveries so others can benefit from
   them makes me happy. The pursuit and dissemination of knowledge is in
   itself meaningful to me.

This site and others like it are a missing link--a way to
foster thought, expression, and community. A place where human
connection can exist and flourish without some company designing to line
their pockets with it. A gentle yet steadfast act of defiance against
what the web has become.

# Conventions

1. My site is also available as an [onion
   service](http://jentyxddh2rf47gd3e43kuebyn2xsv6h72gzh46oe4rxyovvm7xe5ead.onion/)
   for those that want/need more privacy. To access the onion service, use
   [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

1. [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/ "GNU Privacy Guard") encryption using
   [my public GPG Key](pubkeys/eurydice.key) is preferred [when
   corresponding via email](mailto:eurydice@riseup.net
   "eurydice@riseup.net"). Remember to attach your public key so I can
   send an encrypted message back.

1. Any word with a trailing number enclosed in parentheses,
   e.g. [`help(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/help), is a link to
   a [`man(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/man) page. The number represents
   the section number of that man page.

1. In command line examples, a dollar sign `($)` represents a shell
   without root permissions; conversely, an octothorpe `(#)` represents
   a shell with root permissions. Root can be acquired via
   [`su(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/su) or
   [`doas(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/doas), though the latter is
   preferred.

1. I try my best to write readable, comprehensible software. To that
   end, suggestions and diffs are welcome--mail them to the address
   above. Thank you.
