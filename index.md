# There's no place like /home

Hey, I'm Ashlen. I'm an [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) fanatic
among other things. I maintain `amissing.link` because, firstly,
a personal website is among the freest forms of expression a person can
have. Secondly, writing about and sharing my discoveries so others can
benefit from them makes me happy. The pursuit and dissemination of
knowledge is in itself meaningful to me.

[GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/ "GNU Privacy Guard") encryption using [my
public GPG Key](pubkeys/eurydice.key) is preferred [when corresponding
via email](mailto:eurydice@riseup.net "eurydice@riseup.net"), remember
to attach yours so I can send an encrypted message back.

Any word with a trailing number in parentheses,
e.g. [`help(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/help), is a link to
a [`man(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/man) page. The number represents
the corresponding section.

I aspire to write readable, comprehensible software. To that end,
suggestions and diffs are welcome--mail them to the address above. Thank
you.
