# There's no place like /home

Hey, I'm Ashlen. I'm an [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) fanatic and
a musician among other things. Passion, a sense of humor (even dad jokes
have their place), resilience, humility, kindness, a will to improve,
and an open mind are qualities I value in a person.

I maintain `amissing.link` for four main reasons:

1. A personal website is among the freest forms of expression a person
   can have.

1. Many sites these days are overengineered and/or hostile to those that
   value privacy. Developing and hosting a minimal, privacy-respecting
   website allows me to be the change I want to see in the world.

1. The act of sharing my discoveries sparks joy ([which means I get to
   keep them](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/does-it-spark-joy)).
   Pursuing and disseminating knowledge is in itself meaningful to me.

1. Organizing my thoughts somewhere allows me to understand myself to a
   greater extent. Otherwise, they vanish into the ether.

This site and others like it are a missing link--a way to foster
thought, expression, and community. A place where connection can exist
and flourish without some company designing to line their pockets with
it. A gentle yet steadfast act of defiance against what the web has
become.

# Conventions

1. My site is also available as an [onion
   service](http://jentyxddh2rf47gd3e43kuebyn2xsv6h72gzh46oe4rxyovvm7xe5ead.onion/)
   for those that want/need more privacy. To access the onion service,
   use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

1. [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/ "GNU Privacy Guard") encryption using
   [my public GPG Key](pubkeys/eurydice.key) is preferred [when
   corresponding via email](mailto:eurydice@riseup.net
   "eurydice@riseup.net"). Remember to attach your public key so I can
   send an encrypted message back.

1. Any word with a trailing number enclosed in parentheses, e.g.
   [`help(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/help), is a link to a
   [`man(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/man) page. The number represents
   the section number of that man page.

1. In command line examples, a dollar sign `($)` represents a shell
   without root permissions; conversely, an octothorpe `(#)` represents
   a shell with root permissions. Root can be acquired via
   [`su(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/su) or
   [`doas(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/doas), though the latter is
   preferred.

1. I try my best to write readable, comprehensible software. To that
   end, suggestions and diffs are welcome--mail them to the address
   above. Thank you.
