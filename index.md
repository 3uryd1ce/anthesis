# Welcome to anthes.is

IMPORTANT: Today (Tue Jan 31 2023) I've noticed that NS records for my domain
have been removed from the `.is` zone, and that the domain name itself is on
hold according to information from WHOIS. I'm unsure why this has happened, but
I'm looking into it. I received unexpected traffic from too many IPs to count,
alternating between one specific page at a time in bursts. I'm guessing the site
was linked somewhere, but it's really too early to say if those two events are
correlated at all. The server itself appears to be OK, and I'm also OK.

Maybe you already know how inviting and pleasant it can feel to interact with
and learn about Unix-like operating systems. Or perhaps you regard them with
less familiarity and ease because you have yet to fully discover how comfortable
and engaging they can be. In any case, remember that no matter how much you
wander, you can always find your way back `/home`.

Some other subjects I find fascinating are here as well. Feel free to continue
down this home page to see what captivates you.
