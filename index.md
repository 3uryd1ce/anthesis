# Why amissing.link?

Despite the name, it's not a [commentary on human
evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_link_(human_evolution)). I chose
this domain because it has a nice ring to it and it's memorable.

# Who are you?

I'm Ashlen. :3 I program and administrate servers; sometimes, I even
know what I'm doing. :) My "About" page lists other interests.

GPG encryption using [my public GPG Key](pubkeys/eurydice.key) is
preferred when corresponding via email [(eurydice@riseup.net)]
(mailto:eurydice@riseup.net), remember to attach yours so I can
decrypt the message and send one back.

I prefer [`signify(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/signify.1) for
signing/verification, here's [my public signify
key](pubkeys/eurydice.pub).

Note that `signify(1)` isn't capable of encrypting messages.
