Hey, welcome to my blog. My name is Ashlen, and I mainly write about
technology and software. Areas of particular interest are OpenBSD,
self-hosting, system administration, programming, online privacy, and
cybersecurity. I also like to share tips and tricks that help me out in
the day-to-day.

Articles are sorted in reverse chronological order within their
respective categories. To keep up with new content, [subscribe to my RSS
