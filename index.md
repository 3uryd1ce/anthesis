# Why "amissing.link?"

Despite the name, it's not a [commentary on human
evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_link_(human_evolution)). I chose
this domain because it has a nice ring to it and it's memorable.

# Who are you?

I'm Ashlen. :3 I program and administrate servers; given the
opportunity, I automate repetitive things so my attention can be
directed elsewhere. :) My "About me" lists other interests.

GPG encryption using [my public GPG Key](pubkeys/eurydice.key) is
preferred when corresponding via email [(eurydice@riseup.net)]
(mailto:eurydice@riseup.net), remember to attach yours so I can
decrypt the message and send one back.

I prefer [`signify(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/signify.1) for
signing/verification, here's [my public signify
key](pubkeys/eurydice.pub).

Note that `signify(1)` isn't capable of encrypting messages.

# What [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) OS should I use?

Check out [Librehunt](https://librehunt.org/) if you're new to this. :)

Personalized recommendations tend to be more meaningful, though it's
hard to go wrong with the [Cinnamon
edition](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=281) of [Linux
Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/). In fact, a USB flash drive with Linux
Mint is always on my person in case someone wants me to set it up for
them.

I use OpenBSD as my daily driver, but I wouldn't recommend it to the
average user (though ["Building an accessible OpenBSD
laptop"](https://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan2019-accessible-openbsd-laptop.pdf)
was a fascinating read). A good 'out-of-box experience' with a low
learning curve is most appropriate.

Use a privacy-respecting OS for your mobile device if you
can. [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is what I use, although
[LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) supports a wider range of
hardware.

Your router is a computer too. OEM firmware rarely proves as capable as
[FLOSS
firmware](https://www.privacytools.io/operating-systems/#firmware). Be
careful and use Ethernet when you flash the firmware onto your
router. Fixing a bricked router is not fun for most people.
