# There's no place like /home

Hey, welcome to my blog. I mainly write about technology and software.
Areas of particular interest are OpenBSD, self-hosting, system
administration, programming, online privacy, and cybersecurity. I also
like to share tips and tricks that help me out in the day-to-day.
