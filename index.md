# Step into your /home

Maybe you already know how welcoming and pleasant it can feel to interact with
and learn about Unix-like environments. Or perhaps you're less familiar and at
ease with them because you have yet to fully discover how comfortable they can
be. In any case, many people have an evergrowing collection of things that
engage and intrigue them, so feel free to continue down this page and see how
many of my interests captivate you. Remember that no matter how much you wander,
you can always find your way back `/home`.
