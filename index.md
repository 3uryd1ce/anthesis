# Step into your /home

You may already know how welcoming and pleasant a Unix-like environment can be,
or maybe you have yet to discover it. It's also OK if the way you feel more
engaged is by learning about other subjects. Feel free to scroll down and
explore the articles below to find how many interests of mine capture your
attention. No matter where you wander off to, you can always come back `/home`.
