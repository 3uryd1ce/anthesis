# Articles and write-ups

To keep up with new content, [subscribe to my RSS feed](/rss.xml).

Articles are sorted in reverse chronological order within their
respective categories.

At one point, I updated the date of articles whenever I made any change
to them. After some thought, it's more logical to let the date
correspond to when an article was published.

All articles before this change have a date of October 24th.
