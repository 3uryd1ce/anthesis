# Articles and write-ups

To keep up with new content, [subscribe to my RSS feed](/rss.xml).

Articles are sorted in reverse chronological order within their
respective categories.

Formerly, I changed the date of articles whenever I modified them. Upon
further reflection, the day an article was published is more useful as a
date. All articles before this change have a date of October 24th.
