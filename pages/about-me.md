# Interests

- Audio gear. My current collection includes the [Hifiman
  Sundara](https://hifiman.com/products/detail/286), [Sennheiser
  HD600](https://sennheiser.com/best-audio-headphones-high-end-stereo-hifi-hd-600)
  and [E-MU
  Teak](https://sg.creative.com/p/headphones-headsets/e-mu-teak). To
  drive my headphones and produce better sound, the [Monoprice Monolith
  THX
  887](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/monoprice-monolith-thx-887-balance-headphone-amp-new-champ.8942/)
  sits on my desk
  with the [Topping
  E30](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/topping-e30-dac-review.12119/)
  on top of it. [Audio Science
  Review](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/) is a good resource for
  amplifiers and
  [DACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter "Digital-to-analog converters").
- [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software "Free/Libre and Open Source Software")
  (though I think of it as a lifestyle/set of convictions rather than an
  interest). I [self-host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)).
- Gaming. My favorite genres include
  [Metroidvanias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania),
  platformers, <abbr title="Role-playing games">RPGs</abbr>,
  [roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), and strategy
  games.
- Meditation. There are many different types of meditation, but the
  specifics matter less than consistency and dedication in my
  experience.
- Music. I practice piano regularly as a means of self-expression,
  mostly by ear as I have perfect pitch.
- Philosophy. Let's save that discussion for later, lest we put
  [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes) before the horse.
- Programming and tech, in part because they present interesting
  problems for me to solve. Unlike spoken languages where many things
  are implicitly conveyed and understood, computers follow the letter of
  the law and not the spirit of it.
- Psychology. I find it fascinating that every person I cross paths
  with, regardless of whether or not we ever end up speaking, probably
  leads a life as complex as my own. They have moments of joy, doubt,
  hope, sadness, and so on, just like I do. It's why I engage in the
  [principle of
  charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity).
- Self-improvement and learning. Simply put, I wouldn't be me without
  those desires.
- Writing. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn, not to mention
  that writing can be fulfilling and thought-provoking. Sometimes it's
  as simple as jotting down ideas on occasion. I started to
  document my ideas when I realized that many of the things I told
  myself I'd remember and do something about later never came to
  fruition.
