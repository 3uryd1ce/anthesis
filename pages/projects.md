# Projects

Source code of various projects I keep myself busy with is published
here. I generate <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
pages from git repositories with
[stagit](https://github.com/oxalorg/stagit) ([Roman
Zolotarev](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/stagit.html) brought my
attention to this fantastic program).

Note that `.git` needs to be added at the end of the given repository's
<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> in order to clone
it. For example, to clone my dotfiles:

```
git clone "https://amissing.link/src/dotfiles/.git"
```

- [Website (Markdown)](../src/website_md)
- [Dotfiles](../src/dotfiles)
- [Btstrp](../src/btstrp)
