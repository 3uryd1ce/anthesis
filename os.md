# FLOSS OS recommendations

Check out [Librehunt](https://librehunt.org/) if you're new to this. It
does a good job of explaining the merits of FLOSS and suggests operating
systems based on how you answer its quiz.

If you want a personal recommendation, first look within yourself and
assess what you want out of an OS. Figure out whether you want to
maintain a similar workflow or if you're willing to explore change and
put in the effort to learn a different, more minimal way of doing
things.

The former camp of people should likely go with the [Cinnamon edition of
Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=281). I believe in
this OS enough that a USB flash drive with Linux Mint is always on my
person in case someone wants me to set it up for them. It provides
a familiar interface and full-featured applications. They dedicate a lot
of time to making things intuitive, yet it still has all of the power
and customizability of a Unix-like system.

Those that are willing to dive deeper and aren't afraid to take some
time to learn, take a look at [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/). It
keeps things simple, yet the system is robust enough to handle many
different use cases. OpenBSD as a system feels
transparent/comprehensible due to great documentation and minimal tools
that work together. These things along with a proactive attitude toward
security makes OpenBSD comfy, in a word. It takes time to learn how it
works--OpenBSD will inevitably differ from what you're used to. Yet it's
worth every second of what you put in, or at least it has been for me.

Use a privacy respecting OS for your mobile device if you
can. [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is what I use, although
[LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) supports a wider range of
hardware.

Your router is a computer too. OEM firmware rarely proves as capable as
[FLOSS
firmware](https://www.privacytools.io/operating-systems/#firmware). Be
careful and use Ethernet when you flash the firmware onto your
router. Fixing a bricked router isn't fun for most people.
