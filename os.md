# FLOSS OS recommendations

[![The absolute state of Linux
distributions.](/images/standards.png)](/images/standards.png)

The above [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/927/) illustrates a particular
mindset that is responsible for the wealth of Linux distributions
targeted at users new to the platform. Given this, I don't have a
one-size-fits-all recommendation; each user has different needs, so
pigeonholing is counterproductive. For instance, someone that feels more
comfortable with an interface akin to macOS could have a bad time with
[Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php), even though Linux
Mint is a great OS for many people.

However, I'll share a quiz I find helpful, as well as what works for
me.

## Generate recommendations from a quiz

Check out [LibreHunt](https://librehunt.org/). LibreHunt does a good job
of explaining the merits of FLOSS and suggests Linux distributions based
on how the questionnaire is answered.

## What I use

[![The OpenBSD logo with the mascot, Puffy the pufferfish, above it.](/images/openbsd-logo.png "Puffy is one of my favorite mascots.")](/images/openbsd-logo.png)

See ["Why
OpenBSD?"](/why-openbsd.html) for more details.

## Other devices to liberate

### Smartphone

It's best to use a privacy respecting OS here, too.
[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is what I use, although
[LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) supports a wider range of
hardware.

### Router

A router is a computer too. Proprietary consumer firmware isn't
exceedingly capable, nor is it secure. DD-WRT, OpenWRT, pfSense, and
OpenBSD are all much better options. If flashing firmware onto a
consumer router, use Ethernet and take the appropriate precautions.

Check out [Building an OpenBSD router](/openbsd-router.html) for more
information on how I approach it.
