# FLOSS OS recommendations

## Generate recommendations from a quiz

Check out [Librehunt](https://librehunt.org/) if you want something more
hands-on. Librehunt does a good job of explaining the merits of FLOSS
and suggests operating systems based on how you answer its
questionnaire.

## My recommendations

First assess what you want and need in an OS. Do you want to maintain
a similar workflow or do you want to learn a more minimal way of doing
things?

### Maintaining a similar workflow

Try [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php),
specifically the Cinnamon Edition. I believe in this OS enough that
a USB flash drive with Linux Mint is always on my person in case someone
wants me to set it up for them.

Linux Mint provides a familiar interface and full-featured applications
so the user can hit the ground running. The developers dedicate a lot of
time to make the system intuitive without a sacrifice in customizability
and I really appreciate that approach.

### Trying something different

Take a look at [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/). It follows the KISS
philosophy, yet the system is robust enough to handle many different use
cases (building a web server or a router is feasible using only the
tools available in the base system).

OpenBSD feels transparent and comprehensible due to great documentation
and minimal tools that work together. These things along with
a proactive attitude toward security makes OpenBSD comfy, in a word.

That said, make no mistake: while it comes with good defaults, OpenBSD
requires a bit of reading. While full-featured desktop environments like
GNOME are available, the system itself doesn't graphically abstract away
tasks in the name of user friendliness. Believe it or not, this is
actually a blessing in disguise--if you learn how the system works as
you go, that incremental understanding allows you to do new things and
fix problems should they arise.

If you do install it, remember to consult the FAQ. It's particularly
useful to newcomers as it shows you how to perform common tasks.

OpenBSD will inevitably differ from what you're used to, yet it's worth
every second of what you put in.

## Other devices you can liberate

### Smartphone

Use a privacy respecting OS for your mobile device if you can.
[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is what I use, although
[LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) supports a wider range of
hardware.

### Router

Your router is a computer too. OEM firmware usually isn't as capable nor
as secure as its FLOSS counterparts (such as DD-WRT, OpenWRT, pfSense,
or OpenBSD). Be careful and use Ethernet if you flash firmware onto your
router.
