# FLOSS OS recommendations

Check out [Librehunt](https://librehunt.org/) if you're new to this. It
does a good job of explaining the merits of FLOSS and what might work
for you in terms of an operating system.

If you want a personal recommendation, first look within yourself and
assess what you want out of an OS. Figure out whether you're a) an
average user that wants to keep a similar workflow to what you already
have or b) someone that isn't afraid of change, who's willing to put in
the effort to learn a different, more minimal, and more efficient way of
doing things.

The former camp of people should go with the [Cinnamon edition of Linux
Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=281). I believe in this
OS enough that a USB flash drive with Linux Mint is always on my person
in case someone wants me to set it up for them. It provides a familiar
interface and full-featured applications.

Those that are willing to dive deeper and aren't afraid to take some
time to learn, take a look at OpenBSD. It keeps things simple, yet the
system is robust enough to handle many different use cases. OpenBSD is
comprehensible, well-documented, and proactively secure. Comfy, in
a word. It takes time to learn how it works and OpenBSD is likely
substantially different from what you're used to, yet it's worth every
second of what you put in. At least it has been for me.

Use a privacy respecting OS for your mobile device if you
can. [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is what I use, although
[LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) supports a wider range of
hardware.

Your router is a computer too. OEM firmware rarely proves as capable as
[FLOSS
firmware](https://www.privacytools.io/operating-systems/#firmware). Be
careful and use Ethernet when you flash the firmware onto your
router. Fixing a bricked router isn't fun for most people.
