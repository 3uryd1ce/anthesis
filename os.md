# FLOSS OS recommendations

Check out [Librehunt](https://librehunt.org/) if you're new to this. It
does a good job of explaining the merits of FLOSS and what might work
for you in terms of an operating system.

If you want a personal recommendation, first look within yourself and
assess what you want out of an OS. Figure out whether you want to
maintain a similar workflow or if you're willing to explore change and
put in the effort to learn a different, more minimal way of doing
things.

The former camp of people should likely go with the [Cinnamon edition of
Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=281). I believe in
this OS enough that a USB flash drive with Linux Mint is always on my
person in case someone wants me to set it up for them. It provides
a familiar interface and full-featured applications.

Those that are willing to dive deeper and aren't afraid to take some
time to learn, take a look at OpenBSD. It keeps things simple, yet the
system is robust enough to handle many different use cases. OpenBSD as
a system feels transparent/comprehensible due to great documentation and
it's proactively secure. Comfy, in a word. It takes time to learn how it
works and OpenBSD likely differs in some ways from what you're used to,
yet it's worth every second of what you put in. At least it has been for
me.

Use a privacy respecting OS for your mobile device if you
can. [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is what I use, although
[LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) supports a wider range of
hardware.

Your router is a computer too. OEM firmware rarely proves as capable as
[FLOSS
firmware](https://www.privacytools.io/operating-systems/#firmware). Be
careful and use Ethernet when you flash the firmware onto your
router. Fixing a bricked router isn't fun for most people.
