# Software I use (PC)

This page is retired. It requires continuous maintenance otherwise, and
is consistently out of date.

Nonetheless, here are some resources that I find useful to find software:

- [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications)
- [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/)
- [Prism break](https://prism-break.org)
- [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/)
- ["Awesome" topic on github](https://github.com/topics/awesome)
