Due to spam, I'll link to plain text files so that web scrapers won't
have as easy a time. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Some methods may use [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/ "GNU Privacy Guard"). Here is the fingerprint for [my public key](/pubkeys/eurydice.asc).

GPG encryption using my public GPG Key is preferred when corresponding
via email. Remember to attach your public key so I can send an encrypted
message back.
