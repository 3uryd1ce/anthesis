# Projects

I publish the source code of various projects
here. [stagit](https://github.com/oxalorg/stagit) generates HTML pages
from git repositories ([Roman
Zolotarev](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/stagit.html) brought my
attention to this fantastic program).

Note that `.git` must be appended to the given repository's URL in order
to clone it. For example, to clone my dotfiles:

```
git clone "https://amissing.link/src/dotfiles/.git"
```

- [Website (Markdown)](/src/website_md)
- [Dotfiles](/src/dotfiles)
- [COBS](/src/cobs)
