## What is F-Droid?

From the [F-Droid website](https://www.f-droid.org/):

>"F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source
>Software) applications for the Android platform. The client makes it
>easy to browse, install, and keep track of updates on your device."

## Why F-Droid?

For the reasons outlined in ["Why self-host/use
FLOSS?"](/why-self-host.html), one should use FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open
Source Software) whenever possible. The source code is available for
every app on F-Droid.

## F-Droid apps

- [ImagePipe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.kaffeemitkoffein.imagepipe/)
  or
  [Scrambled
  Exif](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif/).
  Both apps are designed to remove EXIF data, metadata in photos that
  can betray personal information, before sending pictures. Despite
  serving a similar purpose, the two apps differ in implementation and
  in terms of features. Notably, ImagePipe also reduces image size
  (though it keeps the original unaltered and stores the changed copy in
  a separate folder), which may or may not be a desirable feature
  depending on use case.

- [KISS Launcher](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/). I
  find that pinning a few choice apps and searching for the rest with
  KISS Launcher is a more pleasant experience relative to the default
  [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) launcher. Also, launchers allow
  one to use custom icons (I use [Ameixa
  Monochrome](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.xphnx.ameixamonochrome/)).

- [mpv-android](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/is.xyz.mpv/). For those
  that love [mpv](https://mpv.io/) and want it on their phone, too.

- [Netguard](https://netguard.me/). Block access to the internet per
  application. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to combine it with
  Orbot yet.

- [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/). NewPipe allows the user to watch
  YouTube privately on their smartphone; in addition, the user can keep
  up with their favorite content creators without signing up for an
  account.

- [Orbot](https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.torproject.android/). An
  invaluable tool for privacy, Orbot tunnels the traffic of selected
  apps through Tor.

- [RedReader](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.quantumbadger.redreader/),
  an unofficial open-source client for Reddit. It has a clean UI with no
  nonsense. I found it through word of mouth, as I've never liked the
  redesign and wanted to find a less feature-rich (and frankly less
  buggy) client than Slide. This is exactly what RedReader provides.

- [Termux](https://termux.com/). Termux is a terminal emulator for
  Android, and offers an incredible amount of power. I use Termux to
  securely transfer files between my smartphone and computer using SSH,
  and my dotfiles are there, too.

- [Yet Another Call
  Blocker](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dummydomain.yetanothercallblocker/).
  Quite a useful app. If you have a problem with specific area codes
  calling your number, you can input them in YACB and it will filter
  them out automatically. You can, of course, exempt contacts from being
  treated as unknown callers, and YACB even has an option to stop the
  call before the phone starts ringing on Android 7+.

- [UntrackMe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.fedilab.nitterizeme/).
  UntrackMe transforms certain links, such as YouTube, Twitter, and
  Instagram, to point at a FLOSS privacy respecting alternative. In the
  case of Twitter, it changes the domain to a Nitter instance, for example.
